## About the game

There are 2 mods to play:

- 1 vs 1
- 1 vs computer

Each player can click on a box. After each click, there can be a hit or a miss displayed accordingly by `red X` or `grey circle`.

On Each hit the corresponding ship will have a `red X`. This will continue until that ship is sank and a grey color will be displayed.

The game can be configured to play against the computer or againts another player. Each player name is configurable.

### Future improvements.

- Add table size configuration
- Add number of ships configuration.
- If there is no chance for the other player to win the game, stop the game immediately and display the winner.
